# Seam-Carver
A completely different approach to re-sizing images. 
Using the approach taken in this research [paper](http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~avidan/papers/imretFinal.pdf), this program resizes images in a content aware manner.

#Future
I will most likely convert this to a web app using Flask.

#Motivation
I wanted to write this so that I can get comfortable writing programs in Python again. I enjoy the concept of computer vision but am still very new to the field so I thought this could be an intro project to it.
